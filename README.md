<div align="center"> Implementation of deep-learning based fashion recommendation models with PyTorch </div>

## ðŸ¤— Introduction

Deep Fashion is a package of deep-learning based fashion recommendation models with PyTorch. Although there have been numerous papers since 2018, we have distributed the model directly into the implementation, following the fact that there has been no officially published model. We aimed to implement the paper as much as possible, but since it is a private project, there may be some other aspects.<br>
Also, there is no mordern loader to use Polyvore Dataset, so I made it. I hope it will be helpful for researchers who use Polyvore dataset to study.

## ðŸ“¦ Datasets
